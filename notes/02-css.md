# CSS
Using `display: block;` will stack elements if they are siblings
Using `display: flex;` will allow for moveable content. Can set to column, side by side, etc.

Font size is usually measured using 'em' units

'vh' units are view height units, relative to the current viewport the website is being viewed on.
'vw' units are view width units.
Using % units are relative to parent container

Use SECTION comment to separate code. *(ex: class selectors, element selectors, etc.)*

Margin is spacing *outside* of an element, padding is spacing *inside* of an element

Padding applies to *all* elements nested in the element

Body tag automatically has 8 px margin. Assign 'margin = 0' to the body for edge to edge display

`footer > div{}` will select all `<div>` elements within the footer element

use `@media` rules for breakpointing images. Define media rules at the bottom of the stylesheet
