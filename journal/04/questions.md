# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > | Synchronous code runs in order, line by line, top to bottom and performs each line one at a time. Asynchronous code is code that can run in tandem or parallel within the same program. |

02. What is an event listener?

  > | An event listener is a function that occurs whenever a certain event triggers it. |

03. What does *REST* stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean??

  > | Representational State Stansfer. This means that whenever the API is called on, a transfer to the user is made which is a representation of the current state of the request. |

04. What is a callback / higher order function?

  > | A callback function is a function that take time to produce a result. It is an asynchronous function that runs once another action is completed |

05. What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

  > | A promise is an object that has 3 states. Pending, Resolved, or Rejected. It represents something that will be done in the future.|

06. Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?

  > | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE |

07. What does the `API` acronym stand for?

  > | Application Programming Interface |

08. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

  > | You must declare the function as asynchronous by appending the async keyword before the name of the function when defining it. |

09. What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?

  > | The purpose of encapsulation is to help group related data and methods or functions together. This helps to abstract data and methods that act upon that data away from the user. The user does not have to fully understand the methods and private functions that transform or interact with the data in order to use it. |

10. What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?

  > | Success is denoted by a 200 response code |

11. What is a 400 error?

  > | A 400 error is a 'Bad Request' |
