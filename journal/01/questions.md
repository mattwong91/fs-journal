# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > | To make collaboration with multiple developers easier. Control which versions of code are in production versus dev. |

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > | Make directory |

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > | A pseudo class describes a state of the element. I think I will most likely be using things like :hover, :checked, :required or :optional. |

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > | A system of priority scoring to determine which css rules get applied to elements. It could be helpful to allow for all buttons to share the same traits, but change only 1 of them to use a different color or other property without losing the original properties. |

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > | It may negate the usefulness of specificity when using selectors. |

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > | The selector, property, and value |

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > | Good design leads to a user having more trust in your website, and can give a sense of branding through design. |

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > | To explore ideas for the look and feel of a website, user experience, page flow and other before creating an actual website or writing any code. |

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > | Yes, low to mid fidelity wireframe are very cost effective and don't require much overhead. Even high fidelity wireframes are helpful as they can give a developer exact specifications to emulate in code. |

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > | This turns the element into a flexbox which allows for easier manipulation of the children contained within. |

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > | the 'height' property and the 'width' property|
